# AutomatePacketTracer
Automate Packet Tracer Routers
Creates a text file called the hostname of the router which the user enters. 

Steps:
The file will only appear after a router has been created(N) and the user has finished with the current router(D) 
Copy text file and paste it into the router

Currently it automatically adds RIP commands to the router script.

Future Updates:
Create RIP class to allow for the option rather than automatic configuration
Create OSPF class to allow for OSPF configuration
Create ability to save router as a csv file to be read in later.


There are 5 options
N for new router
A to add an interface for the current router
D to finish with the current router
Q to quit
R for a reminder of options


Example:

Commands:
